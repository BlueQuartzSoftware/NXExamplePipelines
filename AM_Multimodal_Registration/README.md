# AM Mulitmodal DataFusion Pipelines.

These pipelines were extracted from the paper:
```
Supplementary Material for: Multimodal Registration and Fusion of In Situ and Ex Situ Metal Additive Manufacturing Data 1* 1 2
Authors: Sean P. Donegan , Edwin J. Schwalbach , and Michael A. Groeber
1 Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH 45433 2 The Ohio State University, Department of Integrated Systems Engineering, Columbus, OH 43210

```

The pipelines intend to recreate the data and results as they appear in the paper. The input data is available from [https://github.com/bluequartzsoftware/NXExamplePipelines/releases](https://github.com/bluequartzsoftware/NXExamplePipelines/releases)

## ToDo

The `simplnx` based pipelines still need additional filter writing as of APRIL 10, 2023 to fill out the last few filters of the '05' pipeline.

The `SIMPL` pipelines will all run but the user will need a computer with at least 128GB of RAM to allow the last pipeline (O5) to complete.
